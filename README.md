# XYZVec
Statically allocated fixed-size vectors for working in 2 and 3 dimensions.
These vectors are parameterized over number representations, so the library \
works equally well for floating-point and fixed-point arithmetic.

`f32`, `f64`, and fixed-point (using the `fixed` crate) have been extensively tested. 
Other number representations may work, but have not been tested.
